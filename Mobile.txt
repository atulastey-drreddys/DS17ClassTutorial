The first mobile phone was demonstrated by Martin Cooper of Motorola in 1973. It was a handheld device, but not commercially available until 1983 with the Motorola DynaTAC 8000x. Prior to this, mobile telephony was limited to car phones. The development of mobile phones has led to the widespread use of smartphones today, with over 9.1 billion subscriptions worldwide.
